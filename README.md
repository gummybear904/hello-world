# hello-world

I'm new to coding and learning currently Python and Mathematica for math and physics applications. I've used github to download files and resources before but I've never given it much thought about how they came to exist. Today I looked radio project that some guy had documented and built all by himself, he sourced and built designs for custom circuit boards ready to be printed by third parties. It was no small undertaking, and it looked like he was the only contibutor to it. He could've kept the designs and parts for himself to sell but no, he publicized all of his hard work for free, expecting no compensation. I'm blown away from what has been created by this community. Anyways, I doubt anyone will read this and I'm just procrastinating instead of studing for my calc II final and I've just fallen into a black hole of diy heaven. Wish me luck. In the rare chance that someone does read this, I would appreciate reccommendations for any begginner resources for Python,Mathematica or good statistical computing software. I can't wait to see what this community has to offer in the future and I hope I can contribute some day.
